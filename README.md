seat Number Warning System: When the user approaches their assigned seat, the app will provide a vibration alert to notify them. We'll create a new screen where users can enter their seat number, and when they approach their seat, the phone will vibrate.

•	I've improved the title of the SeatNumberScreen to make it clearer what the screen is for.
•	I've added an OutlineInputBorder to the TextField for better visual clarity.
•	I've modified the alert dialog message to provide more descriptive guidance to the user.
•	I've updated the button text to "Start Seat Alert" for clarity.
These improvements enhance the user experience and make the seat number warning system feature more intuitive to use.

5.	Photo Upload and Processing:
•	The system includes a dedicated screen within the mobile app for passengers to upload photos of their damaged baggage.
•	Passengers can either select existing photos from their device's gallery or capture new photos using the device's camera. Once uploaded, the photos are sent to the backend system for processing.
•	The C++ backend system utilizes image processing algorithms to analyze the uploaded photos and identify any signs of damage, such as tears, dents, or scratches.

7.	Notification Management:
•	The system's backend component manages the process of sending notifications to passengers regarding their baggage status.
•	Notifications are triggered based on events such as baggage arrival at the waiting area or detection of damages in uploaded photos.
•	Passengers receive notifications directly on their mobile devices, providing them with timely updates and alerts throughout their journey.
